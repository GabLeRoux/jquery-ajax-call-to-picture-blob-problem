# jquery-ajax-call-to-picture-blob-problem

Trying to find a way to display picture from ajax call using response as image blob.

Got it working, see [main.js](main.js)

Note: `processData` didn't need to be set to `false` in my case.

```javascript
// processData: false,
```

:white_check_mark: Problem solved!
